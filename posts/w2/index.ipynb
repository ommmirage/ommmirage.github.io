        "Recently, I learned that the main reason why students don't finish online courses is weak motivation, as they are not expelled if they miss deadlines. I decided to push myself to learn more intensively, but I'm afraid of burning out. I talked about this problem with my [GTP Psychologist](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-FGhasb1tZ-therapist-psychologist-non-medical-therapy), and he gave me advice on enhancing my motivation. One suggestion was to tell somebody about my progress, which is why I'm here, sharing my progress with you. :D\n",
