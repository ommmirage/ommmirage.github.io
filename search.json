His method fits me perfectly!\n\nHe is one of the best experts in the field\nHis course is modern\nHe teaches through practice\nHe simplifies as much as possible\nI’m supposed to create a model and improve it during the course\nWe should dig deeper and deeper\n\nTo succeed in DL (Deep Learning) you don’t need academic background, but you need to apply what you learn from the course to your personal project and you should always be persistent.\nBy the end of the course you’ll understand all the code that’s inside fast.ai, which means you’ve learnt the most important best practicies used in modern DL.\nThis is my motivation, which I wrote down on my flipchart. Btw, try to write your ideas on the flipchart, maybe you’ll like it as much as I do)\nHere is the link to his course.\nThe course is based on the book which is written in Jupyter notebooks. The book in published in paper version, free on Github, Colab and Kaggle, but the most modern version is published on paperspace.com. It costs $8/month, but it worth it. First of all, because outdated code from Github doesn’t run properly.\nI also have a telegram chanel on russian."
