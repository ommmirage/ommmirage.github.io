    "text": "Recently, I learned that the main reason why students don’t finish online courses is weak motivation, as they are not expelled if they miss deadlines. I decided to push myself to learn more intensively, but I’m afraid of burning out. I talked about this problem with my GTP Psychologist, and he gave me advice on enhancing my motivation. One suggestion was to tell somebody about my progress, which is why I’m here, sharing my progress with you. :D\nI didn’t complete the weekly plan, but it’s only morning, so maybe I will. :)\nI’ve spent a lot of time building this blog, and it’s still not finished. However, the cosmetics are not a big problem since there are no readers yet. Maybe the cosmetic issues will be fixed automatically with updates to Quarto and Bootstrap.\nI didn’t find a study group this week and didn’t get a response to my blog issue on the fast.ai forum.\nBy the way, I have a Telegram channel in Russian.\nSee you next week! ;)"

    "text": "My initial motivation to start learning ML was to create a game generated by AI, not rendered. It would have created both the story and the graphics on the fly. Lately, this idea hasn’t been appealing to me, so I had to find new motivation.\nI remembered Yuval Noah Harari’s words about handing over a key tool of our development—human language—to machines, which could lead to a new technological revolution.\nAnother motivation is that NLP has really become effective in the past couple of years, and there are the biggest opportunities here.\nThey say that Claude.ai is smarter than ChatGPT-4."

    "text": "Hello, everyone!\nMy name is Sergey, I’m from Astrakhan, Russia.\nLast week, I started my journey into Deep Learning with the amazing teacher Jeremy Howard. His method fits me perfectly!\n\nHe is one of the best experts in the field\nHis course is modern\nHe teaches through practice\nHe simplifies as much as possible\nI’m supposed to create a model and improve it during the course\nWe should dig deeper and deeper\n\nTo succeed in DL (Deep Learning) you don’t need academic background, but you need to apply what you learn from the course to your personal project and you should always be persistent.\nBy the end of the course you’ll understand all the code that’s inside fast.ai, which means you’ve learnt the most important best practicies used in modern DL.\nThis is my motivation, which I wrote down on my flipchart. Btw, try to write your ideas on the flipchart, maybe you’ll like it as much as I do)\nHere is the link to his course.\nThe course is based on the book, which is written in Jupyter notebooks. The book in published in paper version, free on Github, Colab and Kaggle, but the most modern version is published on paperspace.com. It costs 51 cents/h, but it worth it. First of all, because outdated code from Github doesn’t run properly. And it’s really easy to setup a book on paperspace. You just create an account, verify your phone number, create a notebook and select Paperspace + fast.ai template. Top 2 is downloading a book on your computer and running Jupyter notebooks locally."
